> **Warning!** The project is not finished and very unstable.

**Jet** is planned as a compiled general-purpose programming language with a simple syntax and a rich type system.

## Status

Currently it looks more like a transpiler than a compiler.
The syntax of the language WILL be changed in the future.

## TODO

* finish the checker
* improve code generation and type checking
